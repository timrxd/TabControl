# TabControl
Manage all of your tabs using hotkeys.  
Currently being used to emulate [Mute Tab Shortcuts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mute-tab-shortcuts/opcjanmpjbdbdpnjfjbboacibokblbhl) for Chrome, becuase Firefox didn't have a similar extension.  


### Hotkeys:  
| Keys | Function |
|---|---|
| Alt+1 | Toggle audio of current active window |
| Alt+2 | Mute all audible windows except current active window |
| Alt+3 | Toggle audio of all audible windows |  
   

### Changing Hotkeys:
 - Click `Extensions` icon in top right of Firefox window
 - Click `Manage Extensions` at the bottom
 - Click gear icon towards the top of the page
 - Click `Manage Extension Shortcuts` at the bottom
 - Rebind to whatever you want

 ### Issues:
 - Small delay after muting all tabs with `Alt-3` before you can unmute
